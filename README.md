Akomolede Yoruba Android Application

I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in "Collective Intelligence" at Muhammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), where I am enrolled in a course called "Computer Science Method in Collective Intelligence." This course emphasizes the application of computer tools to implement group intelligence concepts, specifically addressing how technology can be leveraged to solve large-scale societal problems. Given that the course mandates the development of tools to implement collective intelligence concepts, I opted to develop a language learning app that leverages the knowledge of the crowd to achieve this goal. My prior experience with Android development using Java was instrumental in this project. I received guidance and supervision from mark Klein, an expert in Collective Intelligence and a research scientist at MIT, as well as a professor at UM6P. As an Android developer with no expertise in Yoruba language scheme and content creation, and lacking the skills to design visually appealing graphics, I sought out experts in these fields to help bring my language learning app to life. Olukunle Joseph Olayinka, a graduate of Yoruba education from Lagos State University, provided the app with well-structured content that he simplified for learners based on his experience in teaching Yoruba language. Ali Opeyemi Bello, a computer education graduate of Adekunle Ajasin University, who had previously worked with my brand online, designed the app icon and other necessary graphics to enhance its visual appeal. Their expertise in these areas was crucial to the success of the project. Once my team was assembled, my initial objective was to conduct a market survey on existing Yoruba language learning apps on Google Play Store. The survey revealed several major deficiencies in the available Yoruba language apps, including the use of non-native speakers or machines to pronounce Yoruba words, and a lack of structured lessons to cater to learners with varying levels of language proficiency. Given the limitations I discovered in existing Yoruba language learning apps on the Google Play Store, I resolved to create an improved alternative that caters to a wider age range of language learners and prioritizes accurate pronunciation. Yoruba is a tonal language, so it was crucial to create an app that emphasizes proper pronunciation. Aside from the collaboration of the programmer, linguist, and graphics designer to create an improved Yoruba language learning app, the project also aims to tap into the collective intelligence of its users to address potential issues in the field. 

This first phase of this app is now avilable for download on play store, this is an open source project aimed at advancing our native language (Yoruba). Your contribution to this project will be highly appreciated!!
